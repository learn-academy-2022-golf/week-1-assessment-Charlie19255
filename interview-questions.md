# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:Git stands for global information tracker. It is used for developers to track changes in code and work off each other as a collaborative effort for a project. Github is the server database which is used to house all the information in Idaho. Developers are able to pull information on their code projects from Github utilizing Git. Using the git software and Github database developers are able to communicate effectively over long distances in order to work on projects instead of the hassle of moving all the developers into one location to work.

Researched answer: Git is a system that lets you manage and keep track of code history. Github is a cloud-based service that lets you manage repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then Github is designed to help better manage them.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: I currently cannot recall any Javascript operators, however I do know that Boolean is able to give us a true or false value. It is one of the six primitive datatypes such as symbol, null, and undefined. A Javascript operator that is able to return a Boolean value are inequalities. This is due to the resulting true, false, or undefined statements.

Researched answer:The logical operators are the ones that will return a true or false result, which is a Boolean value. The logical operators are || (OR), && (AND), and !(NOT). For an example, true||true=true, true||false=true, false||true=true, false||false=false, true&&true=true, true&&false=false, false&&true=false, false&&false=false, !true=false, !false=true.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer:An index a sequence of numbers starting at "0". This is utilized to count a series of characters in order starting from "0" to the end of the characters. A value is an attribute stating that a descriptor has a specific name, number, or saved character. For an example, the index of the word "truck" would be read 0 for t, 1 for r, 2 for u, 3 for c, and 4 for k. A value of truck would be found by the code truck.length. The resulting value would be 4. 

Researched answer:The index is the position of a character in a string. A value can play different roles. From numbers to pieces of text to functions. A value can have a lot of differnt uses while an index can only tell where characters are in a value.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are a list of numbers or words in a square bracket. Strings are lists of numbers or words in quotation marks. They both can be displayed for users to see and used in fuctions. They can be turned into each other utilizing the .join and .split built in methods. Arrays are different since they can be used in loop statements while strings cannot. 

Researched answer: The difference between strings and arrays are that an array is a data structure that holds a collection of elements with the same data types while a string is a collection of characters. An array can hold primitive types of data while a string cannot. Arrays can change through mutators and accessors while strings cannot since it becomes a new string once it is changed.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:Proper pair programming is utilzed to promote productivity and reduce errors in code. This is done by establishing the navigator role and driver role. The navigator's job is to provide the right way for the driver to write code. Instructing what to write and looking out for coding errors and misspellings. The driver's job is to write the code and provide feedback. The feedback from the driver is crucial for pair programming since the navigator could be stuck in one way and the driver can help provide another view point in order for the team to progress. The communication between the two is essential since the two can think of more solutions to problems than one person working by themself.

Researched answer: Two developers in two different places working on the same problem is called pair programming. There are many styles to do so such as driver-navigator, unstructured pair programming, strong style pair programming, ping pong pairing, backseat navigator, and tour guide style. Each one however has a distinct role for each person. One person is in control of the keyboard writing the code while the other is watching over the person writing the code. This is so the person watching over can point out what to write and be on the lookout for errors while the driver can focus on typing the code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: An over function that has functions as inputs and may result in a function.

2. Jest: Testing area for any JavaScript code.

3. Objects: A variable that can contain many values or attributes.

4. Method: Actions that can be performed on objects or variables with many values.

5. Classes: Rubric for creating objects. Like CSS with a type and value called class expressions and class declaration.
